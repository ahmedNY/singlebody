/**
 * PermissionPolicy
 * @depends OwnerPolicy
 * @depends ModelPolicy
 *
 * In order to proceed to the controller, the following verifications
 * must pass:
 * 1. User is logged in (handled previously by sails-auth sessionAuth policy)
 * 2. User has Permission to perform action on Model
 * 3. User has Permission to perform action on Attribute (if applicable) [TODO]
 * 4. User is satisfactorily related to the Object's owner (if applicable)
 *
 * This policy verifies #1-2 here, before any controller is invoked. However
 * it is not generally possible to determine ownership relationship until after
 * the object has been queried. Verification of #4 occurs in RolePolicy.
 *
 * @param {Object}   req
 * @param {Object}   res
 * @param {Function} next
